Module_1.py:
Within Module_1.py is a simple 1D advection/convection and diffusion simulation. The purpose of Module_1.py was to rigorously teach 
myself the foundations of numerically solving and computationally modeling the advection/convection and diffusion terms found in the 
momentum Navier-Stokes equation.

Module_2.py:
Within Module_2.py is a complete and validated 2D fluid/thermo-dynamics simulation using the Navier-Stokes equation and a heat equation 
for convection/advection and diffusion.
